        <h2>Vendors</h2>
        <h3>Vendor applications go live February 1, 2024</h3>
        <p>Over the past several years Vancouver Island MusicFest has made a conscious effort to demonstrate our commitment to presenting a cultural event where the principles of fair trade, low environmental footprint and quality product prevail. Our vendor jury looks carefully at all aspects of your vendor application to understand clearly where you source your product and the impact your product will have on the natural environment â€“ both at the fairgrounds and at the source. All of our food vendors are required to have biodegradable, compostable or recyclable food service materials (cutlery, plates, bowls, mugs, packages) for all of their operations. This is an important part of our efforts to move towards a zero-waste event and it is the standard already in place for our internal kitchens.</p>
