        <h2>About the music fest</h2>
        <p>Over the years, the Festival has grown from a small gathering to one of Canada's premier Roots, Folk and Global Music Festivals. We celebrate excellence in many forms of music.</p>
        <p>
        Our Festival features 5 to 6 stages annually at the Courtenay Exhibition Grounds with each stage having its own distinct personality.</p>
        <p>We follow the model of a traditional Western Canadian Folk Festival with the focus of our programming being on workshops, jam sessions, song circles and concerts.
        </p>
        <p>We feature local, BC, National and International performers.</p>
        <p>We are proud of our musical diversity as well as our inclusivity and accessibility within our Community. We are a family event with a large campground.</p>

        <h2>Comox Valley Folk Society</h2>
        <p>The Comox Valley Folk Society is a non-profit organization formed in 1995 specifically to produce the Vancouver Island MusicFest.</p>
        <p>The Society is governed by a Board of Directors and the Festival is run by a small staff who oversee the Festival which in turn, is run by 1300 spectacular volunteers.</p>
        <p>We are always working to improve who we are and how we do things in regards to the quality of music we present and how everyone is treated at our Festival. You can feel the positive effect of these principles on our site when you attend.</p>
        <p>We remain very proud of our economic impact as one of the primary drivers of Cultural Tourism on Vancouver Island.</p>
